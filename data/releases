      "notes": "# New Feature\n\n* Add `update` genesis command to get new version\n\n  Usage: genesis update [-c|--check] [-v|--version VERSION] [-d|--details] [-f|--force]\n\n    -c, --check       Check if a newer version (or the specified version) is\n                      available.\n\n    -v, --version <x> Install the specified version instead of the latest\n\n    -d, --details     Print the release notes of the versions between the current\n                      version and the latest (or the release notes of the\n                      specified version)\n\n    -f, --force       Replace the current genesis executable.  Otherwise,\n                      confirmation will be requested.\n\n# Improvements\n\n* Improve `genesis kit-provider -v` status output\n\n* Improve `genesis list-kits` hint to include -r flag.\n\n* Make it easier to trace the stack\n\n  Adds the -S|--show-stack debug option, and gives better context of traces\n  and errors.\n\n  Behaviour Changes:\n\n  - internal `trace` output will show the location in the code were it was\n    called. If --show-stack option specified, it will show the full stack\n    instead of just the location.\n\n  - internal `dump_vars` output will now show the full stack instead of\n    just the calling location if --show-stack specified (along with\n    --trace or --debug)\n\n  - internal `bail` will show calling location if --trace or --debug is\n    specified, or the full stack if --show-stack is specified (with or\n    without --debug or --trace).  This allows you to see where genesis\n    terminates without wading through all the trace output.\n\n  - internal `bug` will always full stack where the bug was encountered.\n    This allows the user to paste the stack into a defect report against\n    the genesis project.\n\n* Limited false positives of detected changes in pipeline notify summaries. \n\n# Bug Fixes\n\n* Fix getting non-production github release version\n\n  If user specified version by name, it should include draft and\n  prereleases when looking for it.  This was the initial intent, but the\n  wrong options were set when attempting it.\n\n* Fix error when calling `genesis man` on a kit that does not exist.\n\n* Fixes issue where proto-bosh deployment did not have up to date state file.\n",
