The Genesis Release Engineering teams continue to crank out new versions of
Genesis itself and its BOSH Deployment Kits.

### What's New?

**Cloud Foundry** kit [v1.10.5](https://github.com/genesis-community/cf-genesis-kit/releases/tag/v1.10.5)
was released on May 23rd 2021, which adds support for dynamic X.509 certificate TTL.

### What's Coming Soon?

- The `genesis update` command will allow genesis users to update their genesis
  CLI via the CLI itself. This will be released in 2.7.xx.

- An updated inheritance system will lean toward using convention over configuration.

- Genesis will check for whether Bosh environment variables are set and use them if so.

- The above two improvements will be included in 2.8, which is expected within the next week.

### What's Coming in the Future?

- Carousel Integration: The Carousel tool allows operators to browse and manage Credhub secrets
  in a Bosh-aware manner. Its rotation feature will be integrated into the Genesis CLI to allow
  for credhub credential rotations.

- Credhub Integration: In addition to allowing for rotations of credhub secrets via Carousel, 
  the Genesis CLI will be updated to do accomplish adding, checking, and deleting secrets.

- `genesis config`: This command will give genesis operators a smoother experience for managing 
  `.genesis/config` files. 

- AutoCommit on Deploy: Genesis will automatically commit state to the deployment’s git repository.
  This will ensure that all deployed state is reflected in the repository’s configs and state files.
  
- Cepler Integration: Cepler will generate CI pipelines for deploying and managing Genesis Kits.
  This will decouple pipeline code from the kits themselves.
